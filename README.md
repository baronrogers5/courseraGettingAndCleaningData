# Tidying Data Project

### This project deals with tyding up a raw smartphone sensor dataset.

This repo consists the :-
* README.md file
* CodeBook.md
* run_analysis.R script
* averageData.txt   -- which is the final dataset

### Rules for operation

The code assumes that all the data is downloaded and the initial zipfile is 
uncompressed and the working directory is within the "UCI HAR Dataset" folder.

run_analysis.R contains all the code required.
Just source the script and it should create the output file.
#### Make sure to have plyr package pre installed.
